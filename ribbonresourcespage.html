      <h class="custom_subheading-orange" style="font-weight: bold">Overview</h>
      <p style="line-height: 1.75">
        I built the <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Ribbon Resources</span> app during my Facebook University (now Meta University) Software Engineering internship. During my internship, I completed three weeks of training in Native Android mobile app development, followed by five weeks of independently building my own fully functional Android app from scratch. Each intern created and developed an app on a topic/task of their choosing. Apps had to incorporate complex algorithms, interaction with a database, camera access, integration with a SDK, gesture recognizers, animations, visual polish, and more.
      </p>
      
        <h class="custom_subheading-orange" style="font-weight: bold">My App</h>
        <p style="line-height: 1.75">
          The Ribbon Resources app matches pediatric cancer patients with childhood cancer survivors, so that current and former patients who have had similar experiences can connect and build community.
As a childhood cancer survivor myself, Iâ€™ve experienced firsthand the importance of community throughout the uncertain and scary journey of cancer diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. Through my app, I wanted to allow more people to access this community by bringing them together in one digital space. My app uses advanced algorithms to match current patients with survivors based on similarities and proximity in order for them to connect and exchange resources, advice, or just bond over common experiences or interests. My hope is that this app allows people affected by cancer to have a resource and outlet to find community and form connections with others during their cancer journey and survivorship.
        </p>
       
      <h class="custom_subheading-orange" style="font-weight: bold">My Role</h>
      <p style="line-height: 1.75">
        I designed and developed the Ribbon Resources app from end to end. My work throughout the development included: conceptualization, technical and design research, sketching wireframes, coding the appâ€™s backend and frontend in Native Android, setting up and managing the appâ€™s database, incorporating all the app features and components, testing, and polishing the app into its finished product. <br><br>

      <p>
        - User can log in using their email and create a profile (and can edit profile anytime)<br>
        - User can use their phone camera or camera roll to take or upload a profile photo<br>
        - User can specify if they are a current cancer patient or cancer survivor<br>
        - User can input specifics about their experiences, such as their type of cancer and their treatment location/hospital<br>
        - Users are matched based on their experiences/info<br>
        - User can view fellow app users, and this view can be filtered<br>
        - Matches can communicate with one another, via an exchange of contact info<br>
      </p><br>

      <p style="font-weight: bold">Nice-To-Have User Stories (Optional)</p>
      <p>
        - Users can input helpful information and other resources<br>
        - Users can view information and resources submitted by others<br>
        - Hospital information is supplemented by Google maps API/info, location, etc<br>
        - Users can form groups of matches (expanding past 1:1 matching)<br>
        - Users can internally message each other within the app<br>
        - A resources page/feed, providing helpful and relevant information<br>
      </p>

      <h class="custom_subheading-orange">Project Scope</h><br>
      <p>
        V1 is focused on matching current cancer patients with cancer survivors based on users' profile information, and exchanging contact information between matches. V2 would allow for in-app messaging and communication between matches. V3 would include more extensive matching between a wider userbase, for example between parents, siblings, and family members.</p>

      <h class="custom_subheading-orange">Design Changes</h> <br>
      <p>
        One major change I made while developing my app was <span style="font-weight: bold;"> consolidating the navigation tab.</span> My initial wireframes included five navigation tabs: My Profile, Find People, Dashboard, My Connections, and Resources. Originally, the Dashboard page acted like a homepage with all of the userâ€™s latest matches and a snapshot of their app updates and notifications. The Find People tab would be a designated spot to view and filter other app users. As I developed the app, however, I decided to merge the Dashboard and My Connections tabs into one Dashboard tab, because it was unnecessary to separate the information from those two tabs. Additionally, it would lessen the cognitive load by creating a more streamlined flow for users to more easily navigate between tabs and mentally categorize which information falls into which tab. I also modified the names of the navigation tabs to help simplify the amount of on-screen text, in order to create a cleaner and more organized layout. 
        <br><br>
        For my final app, the new navigation bar included the tabs: <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Profile, Dashboard, Connect, and Resources.</span> The Profile page is a spot for the user to fill out their personal bio, their information to be used for the matching algorithm, and their contact information to be shared with users they match with. The Dashboard tab displays the list of the user's top matches, as well as a filtered search where the user can view other profiles outside of their suggested matches. The Connect tab is a page showing the userâ€™s connections that theyâ€™ve already formed, their connection requests, and profiles theyâ€™ve saved. Finally, the Resources tab is a spot for users to post and share resources and helpful information.

            Within the Profile tab, users can swipe left and right to navigate between the "Profile," "Match Info," and "Contact" pages. Users can also scroll up and down withing pages to view information beyond the bottom or top of the screen.<br> <br>
            I added animations such as the "bounce" animation for the "Get Your Matches!" button that occurs when the user completes their profile, indicating that their matches are ready to be viewed.

I also incorporated the <a target="_blank" class="custom_orange-txt" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/overview">Google Places SDK</a> so that their location would autofill when users entered their current city of residence in the Contact page.

            <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.25rem">Matching Algorithm</span> <br>
            Matches occur between current patients and childhood cancer survivors. To find the most compatible matches for each user, I developed an algorithm that takes into consideration the information entered in the userâ€™s Match Info page, such as cancer type, hospital, treatment types, and interests. It then applies different weights to each of these pieces of information, based on how relevant each is in constituting a match, and then finds similar users based on this information. These matches are then listed in the Dashboard tab in order of their strength (matches with more similarities are stronger than those with less in common).

      <div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;"> 
      <img src="images/Ribbonresources/Group203.png" width="95%" height="auto">
    </div>
      <h class="custom_subheading-orange">Color</h>
      <p>
        I primarily used cheerful pastel pinks and yellows as the color palette for my app, as well as bright pinks and yellows for accents. Keeping in mind the intended audience for the app, I used these tones to create a warm and comforting environment, and the combination of pinks and yellows bring a fun, inviting, and kid-friendly atmosphere. I chose golden-yellow hues as part of the primary colors because gold is the official color of the childhood cancer awareness ribbon. ðŸŽ— <br><br>

In future iterations of my app, I would like to improve the visibility and contrast by being more conscious of how the pastel yellow and pastel pink appear next to each other. For example, the light pink buttons are somewhat difficult to see on the light yellow profile cards (see style guide above). I would instead use my secondary dark pink color (#F52C8A) for these buttons, for example.

      </p>
      <h class="custom_subheading-orange">Typeface</h>
      <p>
        For the typeface I used Roboto, one of the most popular fonts used for mobile Android Apps. Roboto is a readable sans-serif typeface and is also used for Googleâ€™s mobile Android OS, which makes for an even more streamlined, visually clear, and familiar viewing experience. I chose to use a simple and understandable typeface so that the text would mesh seamlessly within the app and allow the content to speak for itself.

        I used Googleâ€™s material design elements throughout my app to create a consistent, recognizable, and visually polished end result. I used rounded material design icons for a friendlier, smoother look. I also incorporated components like the Android date-picker and searchable spinners, which would be familiar components that users could easily understand and use.

      <p>
        One technical challenge I had was finding a solid hospital dataset with API. While it did take quite a bit of digging, I am glad I persisted in my research and eventually found a good public dataset that was useful for my app. Another challenge I faced was in optimization - sometimes my app screens would take a moment to load. In the future, in order to improve the speed of my app, I would implement live query so that pages refresh and load more quickly. 
        <br><br>
        Other future goals for my app are in-app messaging, so that users can communicate directly within the app, as well as the ability to schedule meetings, so that users could have virtual meetings within the app. I also hope to expand the user types so that family members of patients and survivors can have their own app experience as well.
        <br><br>
        From a design perspective, there are certain aspects of my app that I would change and improve in the future. For example, I would increase the contrast between the pastel yellow and pink colors to make the app more visible and easier to read.

        This was my first time building an app end-to-end! It was a big undertaking and I am glad to have had the experience and opportunity to learn and see my project through from the initial concept brainstorm to the final project. I thoroughly enjoyed creating this app and becoming familiar with the ins and outs of app development and design, and I hope my app can be used to help those affected by cancer. I learned a lot throughout this process, from research to creating datasets, coding animations, creating test users, debugging, and more. I also learned a lot about myself as a designer and my desire to build visually pleasing experiences that resonate with the intended audience.<br><br>
        I would also like to thank my intern manager, Dhruhin Kurli, for his guidance throughout this project!</p>
