      <h class="custom_subheading-orange" style="font-weight: bold">Intro</h>
      <p>
        For this project, each team was tasked with selecting a startup from the 2021 Y Combinator startup directory, and designing and prototyping a responsive user interface design (app or website) to bring the startup to life. Teams created new designs from scratch, regardless of if the startup already had an existing app or website. My team chose the company <span style="font-weight: bold">Membo</span>, a premium grocery delivery service, as our startup, and we decided to create a responsive mobile application for our final project. 
       <br> <br>
      
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">About Membo:</span> Membo is a premium European grocery delivery service, emphasizing quality and freshness of goods, bringing locally sourced and seasonal items to customers with next day delivery. Membo's items are delivered straight from the producer to the user's home for a farm-to-table experience delivered with ease. <br><br>
      </p> 
      <h class="custom_subheading-orange" style="font-weight: bold">My Role</h>
      <p>
        I contributed toward research, testing, and creating app mockups throughout the design process, including initial wireframe sketches, lo-fi wireframes, hi-fi wireframes, and interactive and responsive prototyping. I worked on usability testing, design analysis, and making changes based on feedback critique. <br><br>

      <h class="custom_subheading-orange">Research</h>
      <p>
        For our initial research, we studied the Membo company and website in order to best understand the goals of the company, its services, and relation with their customers. We also researched the current market of grocery delivery services and apps to gain better insight on the types of structures and flows customers may already be familiar with.
        <br> <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Our Key Findings & Goals:</span> 
      </p>
      <div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;"><img src="images/research_graphic.png" width="90%" height="auto"></div>
      <p>Most grocery delivery apps use recognizable mobile shopping features, making for a convenient and familiar user experience. Simple "add to cart" buttons and straight forward checkout processes, for example, ensure a streamlined flow that the client recognizes and understands. We wanted to ensure our included these familiar shopping and grocery delivery features so that clients can use our app with comort and convenience. <br> <br>
      We also wanted to emphasize Membo's core values and missions, so that our app highlights the ways Membo stands out from other grocery delivery apps. Membo's products are locally and seasonably sourced, so we wanted to ensure our app focused on this local and community driven value. <br><br>
      Membo also promises to deliver goods that are "fresher than the farmer's market." We wanted this part of Membo's mission to shine in our app, so that clients can be confident that the food they order is fresh and high quality.</p>

        <img src="images/membo_mockups/membosketch.png" width="70%" height="auto">
      </div>
      <p>The initial sketch features a home page, a shop page, a product details page, an order review page, a delivery information page, a "My Stores" page, and a profile page. From this sketch, we pared down the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen  from the 5 options (shop, orders, home, stores, profile/settings) to the 3 options found in our lofi wireframes (shop, home, orders) in order to make the navigation less cluttered and more concise. For our lofi wireframes, we also added more horizontally scrollable sections, each with a "click more" chevron beside its header.</p>

      <br><br>
      <p>
        To evaluate our wireframes along the six axes of usability, my teammates and I conducted a cognitive walkthrough of our key app screens. When referring to “the user,” we are referring to ourselves put into a user’s shoes.

                - The categories were clearly visible, and the user could quick-add items while seeing a list of products in addition to adding them from the product’s detail page. <br>
                - The user could go into their past orders and add items they had ordered before to their current order, which made ordering very efficient.

              <p class="card-text">
                - The sticky mobile navigation tab and the sticky profile link at the top of every screen were standard and easily learnable. The back buttons on profile and product pages allow for easy backtracking.<br>
                - The overflow grid of products made scrollability apparent. The user also noted that the dropdown and search options at the top of the shop tab were easily learnable and standard design. <br>
                - Each category under the homepage has scrollable and clickable links. The user also noted that scrollability was made apparent via the grid that continues off screen, and clickability was apparent due to the button shapes. <br>
                - The order page's list format clearly showed all the user’s past orders and they found that the arrows in list elements indicated clickability, and plus/minus icons in the quantity categories indicated editability.

              <p class="card-text">
                - The user believed that the app used common e-commerce app layouts, lending to its memorability by taking advantage of users’ pre-existing schema of how to accomplish tasks in a grocery-order app. <br>
                - The user believed that finding one’s favorite products could be something they forget how to do between visits, but both the “past orders” in the Orders tab and the search function on the Shop tab would help to mitigate this.

      <span style="font-weight: bold">Improvments Based on Feedback & Testing</span> 
      <br><br>

      <p>
        We went through a round of critique from our peers and Professor, during which we received a variety of feedback on our Lo-Fi wireframes that we implemented in our Hi-Fi prototype. Here is a summary of the suggestions we received and implemented in order to make the app more usable, connected, and visually pleasing:
      </p>


      <div class="grid-container-np">
        <div class="grid-item-right" style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">
          <img src="images/membo_mockups/membo155.png" width="105%" height="auto">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item" style="display:flex;align-items:center;">
          <p style="font-size: 1.05rem">
            In the "Shop" tab, we reduced the grid from three columns to two columns. This allows the product images and quick-add buttons to be larger and easier to interact with on mobile. <br> <br>
            We added recipes within blog posts, as well as the option to view and add ingredients to cart individually or to quick-add the entire ingredient list to one’s cart directly from the blog post.

          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item-right" style="display:flex;justify-content:flex-end;align-items:center;">
          <p style="font-size: 1.05rem"> 
          One big piece of feedback we got during critique was to make the process of accessing one’s “cart” and “orders” more intuitive. <br><br>
          So, instead of having just one tab for orders which includes your current cart and past orders, we separated the current and past orders by having a “cart” icon in the top right corner and a “orders” tab in the nav bar that just handles past orders. <br><br>
          Separating these functions into their own pages streamlined the order and checkout process and improved overall intuitiveness of the app
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item" style="display:flex;align-items:center;">
          <p style="font-size: 1.05rem">
            On the homepage, we rewrote the section header “Featured Deals” to “Fresh In For You” to better display that the items recommended here are fresh, high quality, and personalized based on the client’s past purchases and favorites. <br><br>
            In the shopping tab, we added a second drop down menu to allow clients to shop by producer as well as food category to highlight the “farm to table” idea throughout the shopping experience. <br><br>
            We also made the “Meet Our Producers” section clickable so that from the homepage, clients can find more info such as the producer’s location, products, and recipes. Finally, we incorporated a swipeable gallery of images as opposed to just one image so clients can feel more connected to where they’re buying from.

      <h class="custom_subheading-orange">Color</h>
      <p>
        For our color scheme, we used three greenish colors that were all derived from the same hue: an off-white with a tinge of green, our primary green, and a darkened version of our green. This color palette takes advantage of the fact that green prompts the user with ideas of nature, calm, organic, and freshness. We also utilized a bright yellow as an accent color that made buttons pop-out and a simple, readable black for text color. Our design utilizes the 60-30-10 color rule across the app pages: roughly 60% of the page is the off-white color, 30% of the page is the primary green color, and 10% of the page is highlight colors like the dark green and yellow.

      <h class="custom_subheading-orange">Typeface</h>
      <p>
        A desire for readability informed our font selection: Sans serif typefaces afford better readability on digital devices and work well for headings. We chose two basic sans serif typefaces: Nunito for header text and Open Sans for body text. For even smaller subtext, we used a light font of Open Sans.

      <h class="custom_subheading-orange">Components & Icons</h>
      <p>
        We used primarily rounded, natural shapes across the application to help lessen the cognitive load on the user and fit the theme of our app.

      <p>
        I gained valuable experiences through this project. Some of my key takeaways are that feedback is a gift, the more iterations the better, and communication is key. Some of our most robust app features came about thanks to a suggestion or piece of feedback brought up during critique, usability testing, or our cognitive walkthroughs. Throughout the creation of our app, I also experienced the non-linearity of the design process first hand. Iterations were key to advancing our app and design flow, even if it meant re-trying ideas from a new lens or testing out a new concept or path altogether. Working in a team setting was also wonderful and made for a great collaborative process and even more comprehensive final product!
